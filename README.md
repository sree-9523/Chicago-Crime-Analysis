# ***Chicago Crime Data Analysis***

## **Overview**
This project analyzes crime data from Chicago to uncover patterns in criminal activities, focusing on spatial distribution, temporal trends, and crime severity. The analysis includes comprehensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and preparation for visualization.

## Data Processing Methodology

### **Time-Based Feature Engineering**
- Extracted time components (Date, Time, Day, Month)
- Created DayOfWeek feature for weekly pattern analysis
- Standardized datetime formats

### **Data Cleaning**
1. *Missing Value Treatment*
  - Coordinates (X, Y, Latitude, Longitude): Dropped rows (1.26% missing)
  - Ward & Community Area: Filled with 0 (high missing percentage)
  - Location Description: Filled with mode
  - Location: Filled with mode

2. *Data Validation*

  - Chicago bounds:
    - Latitude: 41.6째 to 42.1째
    - Longitude: -87.9째 to -87.5째

3. *Standardization*
  - IUCR codes: Standardized format
  - Text columns: Uppercase conversion, whitespace removal
  - Boolean conversion: Arrest and Domestic to binary (0/1)

### **Crime Severity Classification**
- Implemented FBI code-based severity mapping
- Categories: Severe and Non-severe crimes
- Based on official FBI crime classification standards

## Features
### **Primary Features**
- Temporal: Date, Time, Day, Month, DayOfWeek
